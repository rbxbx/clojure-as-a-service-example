Why Clojure
===========

!SLIDE
* Lightweight Syntax
 - very little to learn, data and behavior share representation
!SLIDE
omg parens.

I can't read arabic, does that make it worthless?

Pragmatic
---------
 - Nearing two years old, it's not just going to go away
 - first class citizen of the JVM. There is a Java library for your problem, and it's probably a lot more refined than you realize.
  - ie: ruby has can reach out to C, but there's almost no reason you would unless you _really_ had to. It's hard.

!SLIDE
Performant
----------
without the obfuscation. Write code as succinct (if not more so), than your current code, and watch it fly

!SLIDE bullets incremental
people are using it on real projects to solve real problems
-----------------------------------------------------------
 - Relevance
 - 8th light
 - Edgecase
 - Atomic Object
 - ... and plenty of startups
 - ... and plenty of enterprise companies

!SLIDE bullets incremental
Hype
----

 - founded hype, at that. Solves real problems, unlike things such as Node.js (if evented concurrency was a good idea, tornado or eventmachine would be successful)
 - a real chance to innovate and be thought leaders

!SLIDE bullets incremental
making a grand impact on the Ruby and Rails community is really hard right now.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- ... but maybe if we listened to other communities more we could see what we're lacking
- it's a two-way street

!SLIDE
Fun
---
A lot of what attracted me to the Ruby community when I came into is present in the Clojure community

!SLIDE bullets incremental
Want to work with passionate and intelligent people?
----------------------------------------------------
- Attract talent! Recruiting is _HARD_, especially right now
- it's just compounded with super smart JVM/Java guys
- and super smart Lisp guys
- and super smart CS guys

You don't need to rewrite every tool ever.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The ecosystem is already there.
- when you do need to rewrite a tool, guess what, you're a hero. Well done.

!SLIDE
Palpable excitement from the community.

Simplicity vs Ease
------------------

 - Ruby is easy... sort of
 - Clojure is hard(er)... sort of
 - Ruby makes it really easy to get a reasonably tiny system up and running quickly, and achieve sorcery in the process
 - Clojure (and FP in general) make it easier to get reasonably large systems up and maintainable, and achieve wizardry

!SLIDE
Simplicity vs Ease
------------------

A LOT of our apps go longer than 3-4 months. Perhaps we should think about things longer term.
