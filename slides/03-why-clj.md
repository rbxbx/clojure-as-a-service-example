Why Clojure
-----------

* Lightweight Syntax
 - very little to learn, data and behavior share representation
 - omg parens. Whatever, like everything about programming you currently understand made sense to you immediately.
  - I can't read arabic, so it's fucking worthless?

* Pragmatic
 - Nearing two years old, it's not just going to go away
 - first class citizen of the JVM. There is a Java library for your problem, and it's probably a lot more refined than you realize.
  - ie: ruby has can reach out to C, but there's almost no reason you would unless you _really_ had to. It's hard.
 - performant... without the expense of obfuscation. Write code as succinct (if not more so), than your current code, and watch it fly
 - people are using it on real projects to solve real problems
  - Relevance
  - 8th light
  - Edgecase
  - Atomic Object
  - ... and plenty of startups
  - ... and plenty of enterprise companies

* Hype
 - founded hype, at that. Solves real problems, unlike things such as Node.js (if evented concurrency was a good idea, tornado or eventmachine would be successful)
 - a real chance to innovate and be thought leaders
  - making a grand impact on the Ruby and Rails community is really hard right now.
   - ... but maybe if we listened to other communities more we could see what we're lacking
    - it's a two-way street

* Fun
 - A lot of what attracted me to the Ruby community when I came into is present in the Clojure community
   - Want to work with passionate and intelligent people?
     - Attract talent! Recruiting is _HARD_, especially right now
     - it's just compounded with super smart JVM/Java guys
     - and super smart Lisp guys
     - and super smart CS guys
   - and you don't need to rewrite every tool ever. The ecosystem is already there.
   - when you do need to rewrite a tool, guess what, you're a hero. Well done.
 - palpable excitement from the community. Haven't felt that in a while here :(

* Simplicity vs Ease
 - Ruby is easy... sort of
 - Clojure is hard(er)... sort of
 - Ruby makes it really easy to get a reasonably tiny system up and running quickly, and achieve sorcery in the process
 - Clojure (and FP in general) make it really easy to get reasonably large systems up and maintainable, and achieve wizardry
 - A LOT of our apps go longer than 3-4 months. Perhaps we should think about things longer term.
