Making it Real
--------------

* Service Layer behind a Rails app
  - we should probably be designing a lot more of our applications this way anyway

* Full Stack
  - the framework support isn't quite there yet for getting up and running quickly
  - ...but most of our projects last longer than a month anyway
  - and if it truly is tiny enough that it would be a month long project... then the tooling is there

* During the times we're not using Clojure, we will be better Ruby devs for having done so
  - Learning.
  - Learning.
  - Learning.
  - ... Ruby supports (and took!) a lot of abstractions from Functional languages and Lisps
