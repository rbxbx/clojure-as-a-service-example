Why FP
======

!SLIDE bullets incremental
Simple to reason about
----------------------
- inputs yield outputs
- data and behavior are the same

!SLIDE bullets incremental
Simple to decompose
-------------------
- functions are truly first class
- when everything is composed of functions/data powerful patterns of abstraction become available
- currying

!SLIDE
Simple to compose
-----------------
partial application | a function without all it's arguments simply returns a function expecting those additional args

Composition leads to reuse
--------------------------
- Almost anything you can imagine writing that's a general operation, you will almost certainly see that it was available to you before hand.
- Learn to recognize patterns and be tickled by them, intuit that someone smarter than you has probably solved this.

Programming, motherfucker
-------------------------
- it matters
- ...the more you know!
- exposure and experimentation build & refine tastes
- Do you have an argument for not knowing more? Is putting the shoe on the other foot a bad idea sometimes?

Functional Programming (and in turn, computer science) give us a common language to communicate abstract concepts and patterns that

_we_ _regularlary_ _encounter_
